  <h1 align="center">Bootstrap design system</h1>
</p>

This package describes components and tokens from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), so  that a design tool like <a href="https://hadron.app" target="_blank" alt="Hadron Design with code tool">Hadron</a> can use it to provide a design experience with its components.

### Missing components

These components require a bit of JS to be used. The spec should show how to use it, and we could probably add the script needed as a snippet. But these should be web components that encapsulate that functionality and expose it throughout an API.
