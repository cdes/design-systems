  <h1 align="center">Bulma design system</h1>
</p>

This package describes components and tokens from [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), so  that a design tool like <a href="https://hadron.app" target="_blank" alt="Hadron Design with code tool">Hadron</a> can use it to provide a design experience with its components.

### Missing components

- [Content](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/content)
- [Modal](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/modal)
This will requiere a little bit of JS to toggle the class.
- [Icon](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/icon)
Bulma can be used with many icon libraries. It's probably better to just let the icon be handled by other design systems and define this useful class name as tokens.
- [File](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/file)
I've excluded this because it's of little value and I've preferred not to overload. But anyway.. feel free to add it.
